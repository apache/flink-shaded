# Apache Flink Shaded Dependencies

This repository contains a number of shaded dependencies for the [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) project.

The purpose of these dependencies is to provide a single instance of a shaded dependency in the Flink distribution, instead of each individual module shading the dependency.

With the exception of `flink-shaded-hadoop-2`, shaded dependencies contained here do not expose any transitive dependencies. They may or may not be self-contained.

When using these dependencies it is recommended to work directly against the shaded namespaces.

## Sources

We currently do not release jars containing the shaded sources due to the unanswered legal questions raised [here](https://github.com/apache/flink-shaded/issues/25).

However, it is possible to build these jars locally by cloning the repository and calling `mvn package -Dshade-sources`.

## About

Apache Flink is an open source project of [The Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) (ASF).
